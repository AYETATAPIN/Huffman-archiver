## 1) Launch `archivator.exe` or run `Huffman_archiver.c`
## 2) If you want to use a folder, provide a path like `C:\Places\Where\I\Have\Been`. In that case, all files would be replaced by new ones. In case you want to use a single file, type `F` and file name afterwards
## 3) Pick one of two options, `C` - compress, `D` - decompress


## Compressed files have a `.GOOOOOOL` extension

### If you want to be sure that archiver is working correctly, launch `archivator_testing.exe` or run `Huffman_archiver_testing.c` to make sure compressed and decompressed data would be equal
